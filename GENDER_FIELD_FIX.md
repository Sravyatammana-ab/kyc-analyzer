# Gender Field Extraction Fix

## Problem

Gender field showing as "Not provided" despite "M" being present in the document.

## Root Cause

The prompt wasn't strong enough to emphasize that Gender field is MANDATORY and that a single letter "M" or "F" is a valid value.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Enhanced Base Prompt (openai_service.py, lines 107-112)

**Added:**
```
"Extract ALL specified fields - DO NOT skip any field. "
"For fields like Gender, if you see a single letter M or F, extract it. "
```

### 2. Enhanced Gender Field Definition (line 169)

**Before:**
```
"Gender": "Male (M), Female (F), or Other",
```

**After:**
```
"Gender": "M, F, Male, or Female (often just M or F as a single letter)",
```

This makes it explicit that a single letter is a valid value.

### 3. Added MANDATORY EXTRACTION Emphasis (line 182)

**Before:**
```
You MUST extract ALL fields including Date of Birth and Gender...
```

**After:**
```
MANDATORY EXTRACTION: You MUST extract ALL fields listed above. Every single field is required. DO NOT skip Date of Birth or Gender. These fields are CRITICAL.
```

### 4. Dramatically Enhanced Gender Instructions (lines 192-202)

**Added comprehensive instructions:**
```
Gender - ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED: This field is MANDATORY. The Gender field is critical for passport analysis.
- Search for "Sex:" label followed by M or F
- The value is often just a single letter: M (for Male) or F (for Female)
- Look for "Sex: M", "Sex:F", "Sex : M", "Sex : F"
- Also look for standalone uppercase "M" or "F" appearing in the text
- The letter "M" alone means Male, "F" alone means Female
- Extract the letter M or F even if it's just one character
- If you find "M" anywhere in the text near date fields, extract it as "M" or "Male"
- DO NOT return "Not provided" for Gender - this field MUST be extracted if present

VALIDATION: After extraction, verify you have extracted Gender. If not, search the entire text again looking specifically for the letters M or F.
```

## Why This Should Work

1. **MANDATORY**: Explicitly states Gender is mandatory
2. **ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED**: Uses strongest possible language
3. **Single Letter Emphasis**: Repeatedly emphasizes that M or F alone is valid
4. **Multiple Search Patterns**: Looks for various label formats
5. **Validation Step**: Forces verification that Gender was extracted
6. **Field Definition**: Updated to show single letters are acceptable

## Expected Result

```json
{
  "Gender": "M"  // ✅ Extracted (was "Not provided")
}
```

or

```json
{
  "Gender": "Male"  // ✅ Extracted
}
```

## Files Modified

1. **openai_service.py** (lines 107-112, 169, 180-182, 192-202)
   - Enhanced base prompt
   - Updated Gender field definition
   - Added MANDATORY EXTRACTION emphasis
   - Comprehensive Gender extraction instructions

2. **GENDER_FIELD_FIX.md** (this file)
   - Documentation

## Testing Instructions

1. **Restart server**: `uvicorn main:app --reload`
2. **Test with passport**: Upload "manoj passport front.jpg"
3. **Verify Gender**: Should show "M" or "Male" (not "Not provided")
4. **Check all fields**:
   - ✅ Passport Number: W9699466
   - ✅ Name: MANOJKUMAR CHIMMULA
   - ✅ Date of Birth: 10/04/2002
   - ✅ Gender: M (now should work!)
   - ✅ Place of Birth: MANUGURU, TELANGANA
   - ✅ Issue Date: 27/12/2022
   - ✅ Expiry Date: 26/12/2032
   - ✅ Place of Issue: HYDERABAD
   - ✅ Nationality: INDIAN

## Success Criteria

✅ Gender field extracted as "M" or "Male"  
✅ No "Not provided" for Gender  
✅ All other fields still working correctly  
✅ Comprehensive instructions reaching AI  

## Complete Solution Summary

All fixes applied:

1. ✅ **OCR Enhancement**: Better preprocessing (contrast 4.0x, brightness 1.4x, 2000px resize)
2. ✅ **Classification Fix**: Passport correctly classified (not "Aadhar")
3. ✅ **Date Extraction**: Expiry date extracted correctly
4. ✅ **Complete Field Extraction**: All fields including Gender now with strong emphasis

## Troubleshooting

### If Gender still "Not provided":

1. **Check OCR output in logs**:
   - Look for first 500 characters logged
   - Search for "Sex:", "M", "F" in the extracted text
   - If not present, OCR may be missing it

2. **Verify image quality**:
   - Gender field may be in smaller font
   - May need higher resolution image
   - Check if "M" is clear in the image

3. **Try manual OCR test**:
   ```python
   from PIL import Image
   import pytesseract
   
   img = Image.open('manoj passport front.jpg')
   text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img, lang='eng')
   print(text)
   # Search for "Sex:", "M", "F" in output
   ```

4. **Check logs for which preprocessing used**:
   - Strategy 2 or 3 (enhanced/aggressive) preferred
   - Look for successful config

5. **If OCR extracts "M" but AI doesn't use it**:
   - The prompt should now be strong enough
   - Check if temperature needs adjustment (currently 0.1)
   - May need to add post-processing logic

## Next Steps

If Gender extraction still fails after this fix, consider:
1. Adding regex-based post-processing to find M/F in extracted text
2. Using a different model or adjusting temperature
3. Adding a fallback gender extraction step based on name patterns
4. Improving OCR preprocessing further for small text
