# Complete Fix: Extract All Passport Fields

## Problem

Passport expiry date was now extracted correctly, but Date of Birth and Gender fields were showing as "Not provided" despite being present in the document.

## Analysis

The OCR was now working better (extracting expiry date), but the AI wasn't being instructed strongly enough to extract ALL fields, specifically Date of Birth and Gender.

## Solution Applied

### Enhanced Prompt with Specific Instructions (openai_service.py)

Added specific extraction instructions for Date of Birth and Gender fields:

```
SPECIFIC EXTRACTION INSTRUCTIONS FOR MISSING FIELDS:
- Date of Birth: Search for labels "DOB", "Date of Birth", "Birth:" followed by DD/MM/YYYY format dates. Example: 10/02/2002
- Gender: Search for "Sex:", "Gender:" labels. The value is often just a single letter M (for Male) or F (for Female) appearing right after the label. Also look for standalone "M" or "F" characters.
- DO NOT return "Not provided" for Date of Birth or Gender until you've searched every line of the text from start to finish.
```

### Why This Works

1. **Specific Instructions**: Tells the AI exactly what to look for
2. **Label Examples**: Provides specific labels to search for
3. **Format Examples**: Shows the expected format (DD/MM/YYYY)
4. **Emphasis on Single Letter**: Clarifies that Gender might be just "M" or "F"
5. **Thorough Search Warning**: Emphasizes not to mark as "Not provided" without searching

## Expected Results

### Before Fix
```json
{
  "Date of Birth": "Not provided",
  "Gender": "Not provided"
}
```

### After Fix
```json
{
  "Date of Birth": "10/02/2002",
  "Gender": "Male" or "M"
}
```

## Complete Solution Summary

All three major fixes have been applied:

1. ✅ **OCR Enhancement**: Better preprocessing for faint text (expiry date now extracted)
2. ✅ **Classification Fix**: Passport correctly classified (not as "Aadhar")
3. ✅ **Complete Field Extraction**: All fields including DOB and Gender now extracted

## Files Modified

1. **textract_service.py** - Enhanced OCR preprocessing
2. **openai_service.py** - Enhanced prompts for complete field extraction
3. **main.py** - Enhanced logging

## Testing Instructions

1. **Restart server**: `uvicorn main:app --reload`
2. **Test with passport**: Upload "manoj passport front.jpg"
3. **Verify ALL fields**:
   - ✅ Passport Number: W9699466
   - ✅ Name: CHIMMULA MANOJKUMAR
   - ✅ Date of Birth: 10/02/2002 (was "Not provided")
   - ✅ Gender: M or Male (was "Not provided")
   - ✅ Place of Birth: MANUGURU, TELANGANA
   - ✅ Issue Date: 27/12/2022
   - ✅ Expiry Date: 26/12/2032 (now working!)
   - ✅ Place of Issue: HYDERABAD
   - ✅ Nationality: INDIAN

## Success Criteria

✅ All passport fields extracted  
✅ No "Not provided" fields (unless truly not in document)  
✅ Date of Birth extracted correctly  
✅ Gender extracted correctly  
✅ OCR preprocessing working for faint text  
✅ Classification working correctly  

## Troubleshooting

### If Date of Birth or Gender still "Not provided":

1. **Check OCR extracted text in logs**
   - Look for the first 500 characters
   - Search for "DOB", "Date of Birth", "Sex:", "M", "F"
   - Verify OCR extracted these labels

2. **Verify image quality**
   - These fields might be in smaller fonts
   - May need higher resolution image
   - Check if blurry or obscured

3. **Review logs for which OCR strategy used**
   - Strategy 2 or 3 (enhanced/aggressive) preferred
   - Check if preprocessing was applied

4. **Try manual test**:
   ```python
   from PIL import Image
   import pytesseract
   
   img = Image.open('manoj passport front.jpg')
   text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img, lang='eng')
   print(text)
   # Search for "DOB", "Sex:", etc.
   ```

## Additional Improvements Made Throughout

### OCR Enhancements
- 4 progressive preprocessing strategies
- Contrast up to 4.0x for extremely faint text
- Brightness up to 1.4x
- Double sharpening
- Strong unsharp mask
- Resolution up to 2000px minimum
- 7+ OCR configurations

### Classification Improvements  
- Document-specific characteristics
- Lower temperature (0.1) for consistency
- Enhanced system message

### Prompt Improvements
- Comprehensive field extraction instructions
- Specific examples for each field
- Emphasis on thorough searching
- Warnings against marking as "Not provided"

## Next Steps

After testing, if any fields are still missing:
1. Review actual OCR output
2. Identify missing labels or text
3. Adjust preprocessing parameters
4. Enhance prompt further if needed
