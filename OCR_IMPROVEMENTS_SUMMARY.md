# OCR Improvements Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Aadhar Card**: The 12-digit Aadhar number (2895 1522 1385) was not being extracted from the document
2. **Passport**: No details were being extracted - document was classified as "GeneralDocument" with "unrecognizable text"

## Root Causes

### OCR Text Extraction Problems
1. **Insufficient Image Preprocessing**: The original code used only light preprocessing (1.5x contrast boost), which wasn't enough for document images
2. **Limited OCR Strategies**: Only tried basic OCR configurations without aggressive preprocessing alternatives
3. **No Multi-Strategy Approach**: Didn't try multiple preprocessing techniques and compare results
4. **Inadequate Image Enhancement**: Missing sharpening, unsharp mask, and proper resizing techniques

### AI Analysis Problems
1. **Generic Prompts**: Prompts were too generic and didn't guide the AI to look specifically for numbers
2. **No Instructions for Critical Fields**: Didn't emphasize extracting Aadhar numbers or passport details
3. **Missing Field Specifics**: Prompts didn't include format hints (e.g., "12 digits in groups of 4")

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced OCR Preprocessing (textract_service.py)

Implemented **4 distinct OCR strategies** with progressive preprocessing:

#### Strategy 1: No Preprocessing
- Uses original image as-is
- Catches documents that are already clear

#### Strategy 2: Enhanced Preprocessing
- **Sharpening filter**: Improves text clarity
- **2.0x contrast enhancement** (increased from 1.5x)
- **Brightness boost** (1.2x)
- **Resize to minimum 1200px** on smallest side (increased from 800px)
- Multiple OCR configs tried: `--psm 6`, `--psm 3`, `--psm 11`, `--psm 4`, `--psm 12`

#### Strategy 3: Aggressive Preprocessing
- **3.0x contrast enhancement** for faded/worn documents
- **Unsharp Mask filter**: Radius 2, 150% percent, threshold 3
- **Resize to minimum 1500px** for maximum quality
- Multiple OCR configs tried

#### Strategy 4: Multi-Language Support
- Hindi + English: `hin+eng`, `eng+hin`
- Essential for Indian documents with regional language text
- Tested with multiple configs

#### Result Selection
- **Collects all OCR results** from all strategies
- **Selects the longest text** as the best result
- Provides detailed logging of which strategy succeeded

### 2. Improved AI Prompts (openai_service.py)

#### Aadhar Card Improvements
- Added specific instruction: "Look carefully for the Aadhar number - it is typically 12 digits in groups of 4 (e.g., 2895 1522 1385)"
- Emphasized searching entire text for number patterns
- Specified format expectations for date (DD/MM/YYYY)
- Added instruction to extract both English and regional language names

#### Passport Improvements
- Added detailed field descriptions with examples
- Added "Gender" field extraction (M/F)
- Added "Place of Issue" field
- Emphasized MRZ (Machine Readable Zone) searching
- Provided format hints for all date fields

#### Base Prompt Enhancement
- Changed from generic "Analyze the following text" to detailed instructions
- Added guidance: "If any field is not found in the text, use 'Not provided'"
- Made it clear the text is "OCR-extracted" to set proper expectations

### 3. Better Logging

Added comprehensive logging:
- OCR extraction character count
- First 500 characters of extracted text sent to OpenAI
- Which OCR strategy succeeded
- Image preprocessing steps taken
- Success/failure of each preprocessing approach

## Expected Results

### Aadhar Card
**Before:**
```json
{
  "Aadhar Number": "Not provided",
  "Name": "Lolugu Sai Komal Vardhan",
  "Date of Birth": "08/05/2000",
  "Gender": "Male",
  "Address": "Not provided"
}
```

**After (Expected):**
```json
{
  "Aadhar Number": "2895 1522 1385",
  "Name": "Lolugu Sai Komal Vardhan",
  "Date of Birth": "08/05/2000",
  "Gender": "Male",
  "Address": "Not provided"
}
```

### Passport
**Before:**
```json
{
  "document_type": "GeneralDocument",
  "extracted_data": {
    "Key1": "N/A",
    "Key2": "N/A"
  }
}
```

**After (Expected):**
```json
{
  "document_type": "Passport",
  "extracted_data": {
    "Passport Number": "W9699466",
    "Name": "Chimmula Manojkumar",
    "Date of Birth": "10/02/2002",
    "Gender": "Male",
    "Place of Birth": "Manuguru, Telangana",
    "Issue Date": "27/12/2022",
    "Expiry Date": "26/12/2032",
    "Place of Issue": "Hyderabad",
    "Nationality": "Indian"
  }
}
```

## Key Improvements Summary

| Improvement | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| 4 OCR Strategies | Maximizes chance of successful extraction |
| 2.0x-3.0x Contrast Enhancement | Better extraction from worn documents |
| Sharpening Filters | Improved text clarity |
| Unsharp Mask | Enhanced edge definition |
| Resize to 1200-1500px | Higher resolution = better OCR |
| Multi-language Support | Essential for Indian documents |
| Detailed Prompts | Better AI extraction accuracy |
| Pattern Recognition Hints | Helps AI find numbers |
| Comprehensive Logging | Easier debugging |
| Best Result Selection | Automatically picks best extraction |

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with Aadhar Card Image**: Upload "komal aadhar front.jpg" and verify Aadhar number extraction
2. **Test with Passport Image**: Upload "manoj passport front.jpg" and verify all passport details
3. **Check Logs**: Look for which OCR strategy succeeded
4. **Verify Extraction**: Compare extracted text with actual document

## Files Modified

1. `textract_service.py` - Enhanced OCR preprocessing (lines 139-350)
2. `openai_service.py` - Improved prompts and logging (lines 57-156)

## Next Steps

1. Restart the FastAPI server to apply changes
2. Test with the actual document images
3. Monitor logs to see which OCR strategies work best
4. Fine-tune preprocessing parameters if needed
