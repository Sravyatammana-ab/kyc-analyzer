# âœ… Tesseract Fix Complete!

## Problem Found & Fixed

The issue was that Tesseract couldn't find its language data files (`eng.traineddata`).

## Solution Applied

I've updated `textract_service.py` to automatically set the `TESSDATA_PREFIX` environment variable to point to the correct tessdata directory.

The fix:
```python
tessdata_dir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(TESSERACT_CMD), 'tessdata')
if os.path.exists(tessdata_dir):
    os.environ['TESSDATA_PREFIX'] = tessdata_dir
```

## âœ… Verification

Test completed successfully:
- Tesseract installed: âœ“
- TESSDATA_PREFIX configured: âœ“
- OCR working: âœ“

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

**1. Restart your server:**
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then start again:
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

**2. Test in Postman:**
- POST to `http://localhost:8000/analyze`
- Upload your Aadhar image
- Should work now! ðŸŽ‰

**Note:** The server must be **restarted** for the fix to take effect. The changes were made to `textract_service.py` but the running server hasn't loaded them yet.

Good luck! ðŸš€
