# Testing OCR Improvements Guide

## Quick Test Steps

### 1. Restart the FastAPI Server

The OCR improvements require a server restart to take effect:

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart it
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### 2. Test with Aadhar Card

**Expected Issue**: Aadhar number "2895 1522 1385" was not being extracted

**Test Request**:
```bash
POST http://localhost:8000/analyze
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

file: komal aadhar front.jpg
```

**Expected Results**:
- Aadhar Number: `2895 1522 1385` (instead of "Not provided")
- Document should be classified as "Aadhar"
- All fields should be populated

### 3. Test with Passport

**Expected Issue**: Document was classified as "GeneralDocument" with no details

**Test Request**:
```bash
POST http://localhost:8000/analyze
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

file: manoj passport front.jpg
```

**Expected Results**:
- Passport Number: `W9699466`
- Name: `Chimmula Manojkumar` or similar
- Date of Birth: `10/02/2002`
- Issue Date: `27/12/2022`
- Expiry Date: `26/12/2032`
- Place of Birth: `Manuguru, Telangana`
- Place of Issue: `Hyderabad`
- Document should be classified as "Passport"

### 4. Monitor Logs

Watch the server logs to see:
- Which OCR strategy succeeded
- How many characters were extracted
- Preprocessing steps taken
- First 500 characters of extracted text

**Example Log Output**:
```
INFO: Strategy 2: Trying with enhanced preprocessing...
INFO: Converted to grayscale
INFO: Applied sharpening filter
INFO: Applied enhanced contrast boost
INFO: Applied brightness boost
INFO: Resized to 2400x3000
INFO: Strategy 2 succeeded with config '--oem 3 --psm 6'! Extracted 450 characters
INFO: Best OCR result: enhanced_preprocessing_--oem 3 --psm 6 with 450 characters
INFO: First 500 chars of best result: ... (actual extracted text)
```

### 5. Troubleshooting

#### If Aadhar number still not extracted:

1. **Check extracted text in logs**:
   - Look for the first 500 characters logged
   - Search for the pattern "2895 1522 1385" or variations
   - Note if text is garbled or clear

2. **Try different image quality**:
   - Ensure image is at least 800x800 pixels
   - Image should be in focus and well-lit
   - Avoid heavily compressed images

3. **Check Tesseract installation**:
   ```bash
   tesseract --version
   pytesseract.image_to_string(Image.open('test.jpg'))
   ```

#### If Passport still shows as "GeneralDocument":

1. **Verify OCR extracted text**:
   - Check logs for "Passport" keyword in extracted text
   - Look for passport number "W9699466"
   - Verify text contains document details

2. **Check classification**:
   - Classification happens BEFORE detailed analysis
   - If classification fails, analysis won't work properly
   - May need to improve classification prompt

3. **Image quality issues**:
   - Ensure image is clear and properly oriented
   - Try rotating if sideways/upside down
   - Check if ghost image area is too blurred

### 6. Comparing Results

**Before Improvement** (Aadhar):
```json
{
  "Aadhar Number": "Not provided",
  "summary": "This Aadhar card belongs to an individual named Lolugu Sai Komal Vardhan..."
}
```

**After Improvement** (Expected):
```json
{
  "Aadhar Number": "2895 1522 1385",
  "summary": "This Aadhar card belongs to Lolugu Sai Komal Vardhan, a 23-year-old male...",
  "extracted_data": {
    "Aadhar Number": "2895 1522 1385",
    "Name": "Lolugu Sai Komal Vardhan",
    "Date of Birth": "08/05/2000",
    "Gender": "Male"
  }
}
```

**Before Improvement** (Passport):
```json
{
  "document_type": "GeneralDocument",
  "summary": "The document contains unrecognizable text...",
  "extracted_data": {
    "Key1": "N/A",
    "Key2": "N/A"
  }
}
```

**After Improvement** (Expected):
```json
{
  "document_type": "Passport",
  "summary": "This is an Indian passport issued to Chimmula Manojkumar...",
  "extracted_data": {
    "Passport Number": "W9699466",
    "Name": "CHIMMULA MANOJKUMAR",
    "Date of Birth": "10/02/2002",
    "Gender": "Male",
    "Place of Birth": "MANUGURU, TELANGANA",
    "Issue Date": "27/12/2022",
    "Expiry Date": "26/12/2032",
    "Place of Issue": "HYDERABAD",
    "Nationality": "INDIAN"
  }
}
```

### 7. Next Steps if Issues Persist

If improvements still don't work:

1. **Check Tesseract language packs**:
   - Ensure Hindi language pack is installed
   - Run: `tesseract --list-langs`

2. **Try test script**:
   ```bash
   python test_passport_ocr.py
   python test_tesseract_direct.py
   ```

3. **Manual OCR test**:
   ```python
   from PIL import Image
   import pytesseract
   
   img = Image.open('komal aadhar front.jpg')
   text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img, lang='eng')
   print(text)
   ```

4. **Consider additional preprocessing**:
   - Deskewing (rotating to correct angle)
   - Noise reduction
   - Binarization (convert to pure black/white)
   - Dilation/Erosion for better character separation

## Success Indicators

✅ Aadhar number extracted successfully  
✅ Passport classified correctly  
✅ All document fields populated  
✅ Logs show multiple strategies tried  
✅ Best strategy automatically selected  
✅ Extraction text logged for debugging
